          "Definiton_a": "Mapping is a fantastic cultural project, creating and building the world as much as measuring and describing it. Long affiliated with the planning and design of cities, landscapes and buildings, mapping is particularly instrumental in the construction of lived space. In this active sense, the function of mapping is less to mirror reality than to engender the re-shaping of the worlds in which people live.  ... Thus, mapping unfolds potential; it re-makes territory over and over again, each time with new and diverse consequences. ... the various cartographic procedures of selection, schematization and synthesis make the map already a project in the making. This is why mapping is never neutral, passive or without consequence; on the contrary, mapping is perhaps the most formative and creative act of any design process, first disclosing and then staging the conditions for the emergence of new realities.",

By visualizing spatial practice and interpreting a map, researchers can experience data that they were not even aware of. Additionally, we generally understand mapping as a process during fieldwork and urban research to discover, structure and highlight the spatial and social interactions and point out the blind spots, all of which one might not be able to capture by writing field notes, doing participatory observation or qualitative interviews. The map is one piece of data used to make the invisible (or the obvious) visible.",

This is the reason why we sustain mapping is a means, not an end. Mapping should be part of a wider process, another strategy, a means for thoughts, the socialization of knowledge and practices, a boost for collective participation, a challenge to hegemonic areas, the driving force for creation and imagination, a deep analysis of key issues, the visualisation of resistances, the mark highlighting power relations, among many other aspects. In this way, mapping does not lead to tranformation by itself. Mapping is connected to an organizational process by way of collaborative work in graphic and visual platforms ... .",
